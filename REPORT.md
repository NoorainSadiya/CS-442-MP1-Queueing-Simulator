## Summary and Reflection

I implemented a queueing simulator that supports multiple types of processes, singleton, periodic and stochastic. Added a detailed simulation trace funtionality to provide details. I also defined specific contructors and methods to ensure proper handling of events and processes.

I had some issues, like I declared initially a few variables like `int? startTime`, where I faced few issues while doing calculations. And other hurdle might be type handling errors.
